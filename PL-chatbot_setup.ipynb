    "# A Chatbot using GPT and a Database\n",
    "This allows multiple chatbot types (e.g. a health coach and a learning assistant) to be created. Multiple chatbot instances can be created per chatbot type (e.g. a health coach for user X and user Y, and a learning assistant for user P and user Q). Both, types and instances are stored with and referenced by an ID (e.g. a UUID) in the database.\n",

    "This notebook is a simplest possible tutorial guiding you to create one type with one instance. Have a look at the **chatbot_setup_advanced.jpynp** for more advanced features.\n",

      "[\"Hello! I understand that you may not enjoy sports, but there are still several ways you can improve your fitness without solely focusing on traditional sports activities. Here are some suggestions for you:\\n\\n1. Explore different types of exercise: Try out various forms of exercise that don't necessarily revolve around sports. For example, you can consider activities like yoga, Pilates, or dance classes, which are great for flexibility, balance, strength, and body awareness.\\n\\n2. Outdoor activities: Engage in outdoor activities such as hiking, nature walks, or cycling. These activities not only improve cardiovascular health but also allow you to enjoy the beauty of nature.\\n\\n3. Strength training: Incorporate strength training into your fitness routine. You can do this using resistance bands, weights, or bodyweight exercises. Strength training helps build a strong muscular foundation, improves bone health, and boosts metabolism.\\n\\n4. Interval training or HIIT: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest. This type of workout can be effective for burning calories, improving cardiovascular fitness, and increasing endurance.\\n\\n5. Personal training or group classes: Consider hiring a personal trainer or joining group fitness classes that align with your interests. A trainer can develop a customized program that suits your fitness goals and preferences, focusing on exercises that you find enjoyable.\\n\\n6. Home workouts: If going to a gym or attending classes is not your cup of tea, you can find plenty of online workouts or fitness apps that offer home-based exercise routines. These can be done at your own pace and convenience.\\n\\nRemember to consult with a healthcare professional or certified trainer before starting any new exercise regimen, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific needs and abilities.\"]\n"
